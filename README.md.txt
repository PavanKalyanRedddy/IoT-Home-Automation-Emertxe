# IoT Based Home Automation System (Emertxe Internship Project)

### 🔧 Overview
This project was developed during my IoT internship at **Emertxe Information Technologies, Bangalore**.  
It simulates a smart home automation system using **Arduino**, **PICSimLab**, and the **Blynk IoT App**.

### 🚀 Features
- Garden light control using LDR sensor 🌤️  
- Temperature control system using LM35 sensor 🌡️  
- Water tank level monitoring and control 💧  
- Blynk app interface for real-time monitoring and control 📱  
- CLCD display dashboard for local system status  

### 🧩 Components Used
- Arduino Uno  
- LM35 Temperature Sensor  
- LDR Sensor  
- LEDs  
- CLCD (16x2 LCD via PCF8574 I2C)  
- Ethernet Shield (W5500)  
- Blynk IoT Mobile App  

### ⚙️ Implementation
- The system reads sensor data and automates devices (lights, heater, cooler, and valves).
